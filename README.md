## Hacking

The icon can be changed to any from the [Unicode Character Table](https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/) but some might not be available default in your terminal. The colors is an array of [xterm](https://robotmoon.com/256-colors/) supported colors and the number of colors is just the length of the array. Happy hacking 🍻
